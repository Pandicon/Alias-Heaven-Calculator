## Why?
Due to how difficult it is to explain the system to newcomers, I decided to make an app that calculates the role on its own.

## How to use it?
Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/Pandicon/Alias-Heaven-Calculator/releases/latest), download the binary, run it, and then just set the values. It's as simple as that! :D
